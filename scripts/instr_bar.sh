# instr_bar.sh -- the witness of a speed row: a program's instruction count on the shipped build must be at or under the row's bar. The count
# is harness/scripts/util_instr_count.sh's (perf stat instructions:u, the median of 3; WORK is the program's count less OVERHEAD, the count of
# END alone), so it holds at any load, unlike a clock.
#
#   scripts/instr_bar.sh work <bar> <program.sno> [stdin [N]]   WORK at or under <bar> instructions (stdin read N times over, as a workhorse scales)
#   scripts/instr_bar.sh overhead <bar>                         OVERHEAD (END alone) at or under <bar> instructions
#
# The build measured is the one Snobol4.csproj ships: Release with its ReadyToRun pass (an iterating build made with -p:ReadyToRunBuild=false
# JIT-compiles the engine at every start and counts about twice the OVERHEAD), built here first and refused when the ReadyToRun copies are
# not the ones in bin. Prints PASS or RED with the count and the bar.
# Exit: 0 at or under the bar, 1 over it, 2 could not measure (no build, no perf, no harness or corpus beside the repo, a program that fails).
